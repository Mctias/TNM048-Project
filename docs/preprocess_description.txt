Dataset 1 (1960-2000)
Data format example: Norrköpings kommun: {1980: 111111, 2010: 222222}
Processing:
1. Extract name without "kommun".
2. Filter to keep only cities with population > 5000 at any year (to avoid cluttered map)
3. Rearrange to data format: 1980: {Norrköping: 111111, Linköping: 222222

Dataset 2 (1580-1960)
Data format example: Norrköping: {1590: 1111, 1680: 2222}
Processing:
1. Filter away cities with population missing or null (not 0).
2. Filter away cities with population decrease from >1000 to 0 in two adjacent measure points.

Dataset 3 (geometries)
Data format example: Norrköping: {lat: 123456, lon: 123456}, coordinates in sweref99 system
Processing:
1. Transform coordinates to wgs84 (lat/long).

Merge:
1. Merge dataset 1 and 2.
2. Filter out data points with names that only exists in one of the two datasets.
3. Filter out points which not matches a data point i dataset 3 (geometries).
4. Interpolate (linear) population between known years to get data for each year.
